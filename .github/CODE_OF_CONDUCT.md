*Code of Conduct*

**Purpose:**
This document is meant to facilitate healthy, constructive community behavior. As stated in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/osveliz/numerical-veliz/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), this repo does not accept pull requests although you can contribute through other means. It is the wish of the repo owner for all community interactions to be healthy and respectful.

**Where this applies:**
Everywhere. The community interactions made in the Issues forum, YouTube comments, email, etc.

**Whom this applies to:**
Everyone. The repo owner, bug reporters, topic suggesters, commenters, GitHub Sponsors, and the community in general.

**What counts as unhealthy behavior:**
Unconstructive behavior like submitting fake bug reports, spamming forums, etc. Toxic behavior like insults, discrimination, harassment, bullying, violence or the threat of violence, etc.

**Consequences:**
Depending on the severity, I will try to resolve with all parties involved. Violators that just need time to cool off will be suspended for a while. Clearly toxic or unconstructive community members will be banned.

**How to report a violation:**
All reports of Code of Conduct violations are taken seriously. You can submit private reports via email to github@osveliz.com

This document may be updated for clarification or as issues arise.
